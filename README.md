# Features
Clicking on the generate button will provide the user with a prompt of questions asking how long and what characters they wish to include in their password. They can choose a length between 8-128 and choose to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Failure to input anything will notify the user requiring them to make correct inputs. Once the user makes selections a password is then produced in the text box.
